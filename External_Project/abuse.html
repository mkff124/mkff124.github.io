      <h2>Animal Cruelty Laws</h2>
      <p>In 2019, Congress passed a law making animal cruelty a federal crime. 
      The Preventing Animal Cruelty and Torture (PACT) Act made it possible for federal law to prosecute people who have abused animals of any kind. 
      Now we must remember that not all abuse is intentional. It can look like neglect and often than not the abuser does not understand that what they are doing is illegal and wrong.

        <h2>What Can You Do?</h2>
        <p>If you believe an animal is a victim of animal abuse do the following. Document the abuse,
