      <h2>Adoption</h2>
      <p>
        You made it to the adoption page! The next step is to pick your new pony from the list below. 
        But before you do that you must understand that a horse is not like a regular pet. 
        They require special care and a lot of attention from their owners, are you willing to take on the challenge?

        <p>These guys have earned themselves the nickname Terrible Threes due to how incredibly rowdy they are. But don't let their behavior scare you away,
            Lock, Shock, and Barrel have a sweet side. They are incredibly loyal to each other which should count for something.</p>
